A Zettelkasten or card file consists of small items of information stored on zettels, paper slips or cards, that may be linked to each other through subject headings or other metadata such as numbers and tags. Anna now provides users with the capability of maintaining notes with back-links that helps users make use of zettelkasten. And with Deep Data Merge, you can now link all notes in almost any other file. As of now, you are limited to use these special back-links only in the notes.

Zettelkasten suggests that [[Created notes should be atomic]]. These atomic notes can be stitched together with back-links added using a double `[]` bracket surrounding the title. Rather than using a search based method, [[linking notes provides a more meaningful based searching system]] growing memory.
