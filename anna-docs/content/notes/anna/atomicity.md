Concepts that are related must be put together in a single note, and limit the content to a single concept. Capture all the relevant ideas within that note. It makes it easier to form connections, and helps better in memoisation, or while revising. 

> "If your notes are too fragmented, youâ€™ll also fragment your link network, which may make it harder to see certain connections." - [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_atomic)
