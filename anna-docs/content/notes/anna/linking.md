Linking notes is more meaningful while maintaining notes. 

> "Full-text search on its own provides not enough information. Connections will do, especially in the long run." - [Christian @ Zettelkasten.de](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/)

Providing links to these notes, and tracing them back grows your memory on the topic. It will create connections which help building memoisation.
