## Description of the directory structure

- All of the site data, including the content, configuration and static files, are stores in site/. The rendered/ directory generated by ssg is also stored in site/.

- The markdown content for the site is stored in `content/`. It can contain subdirectories along with images as the folder is recursively rendered.
  - The contents of this dir is rendered to the root of `rendered/`
  - The `notes/` folder holds markdown notes which are rendered by a different process and include various note-specific features
- Static assets such as fonts are stored in `static/`
- Scripts are stored in the `scripts/` dir in `static/`
- The layout of the site is configured using html files in `layout/`
  - The `config.yml` file stores the configuration of the site and includes details such as the baseURL
  - The `page.html`, `posts.html` and other necessary layouts define the structure of the various pages of the site such as posts.html, tags.html and regular pages
  - The layout files can be composed of smaller html files which are stored in the `partials/` folder
- Contents in `public/` are rendered to the root of `rendered/`

---

## Building layouts

Each layout file can access any data from the entire ssg

The `posts.html` layout can access the following data

- `{{.DeepDataMerge}}`
- `{{.PageURL}}`
- `{{.TemplateData}}`

The `tags.html` page can access the following data

- `{{.DeepDataMerge}}`
- `{{.PageURL}}`
- `{{.TemplateData}}`
- `{{.TagNames}}`

The remaining pages can access the following data

- `{{.DeepDataMerge}}`
- `{{.PageURL}}`

### PageURL

The `{{.PageURL}}` is of the form `index.html`, `posts/tech/go.html` and so on.

### Elements stored in `DeepDataMerge`

- `{{.DeepDataMerge.Templates}}` - A map that stores the template data of all the pages of the site for the particular url(the URL is the PageURL for the speicified page)
- `{{.DeepDataMerge.Tags}}` - A map that stores the template data of the tag sub-pages for a particular tag url
- `{{.DeepDataMerge.TagsMap}}` - A map that stores a slice of templates of all posts for a particular tag url
- `{{.DeepDataMerge.LayoutConfig}}` - Stores the layout parsed from `config.yml`
- `{{.DeepDataMerge.Posts}}` - Stores a slice of the template data of all posts
- `{{.DeepDataMerge.Notes}}` - Similar to `Posts` but for all the notes part of the site
- `{{.DeepDataMerge.LinkStore}}` - Stores a map which contains a slice of pointers to the _linked notes_.
- `{{.DeepDataMerge.JSONIndex}}` - Stores the JSON index generated for a particular site (primarily used for search and graphing of tags)

### Accessing specific page data

The URL for the current page can be accessed using `{{.PageURL}}`

To access the data for a particular page, use Go templating syntax:

```html
{{$PageData := index .DeepDataMerge.Templates .PageURL}}
{{$PageData.CompleteURL}}
```

To access the page data for `posts.html`, `tags.html` and their respective partials, set

```html
{{$PageData := .TemplateData}}
```

All of the following page data fields can be accessed in the above manner:

- `{{$PageData.CompleteURL}}` : Returns the complete url of the given page
- `{{$PageData.Date}}` : Returns the last modified date of the current file
- `{{$PageData.Frontmatter.[Tagname]}}` : Returns the value of the frontmatter tag
  - Example: `{{$PageData.Frontmatter.Title}}` : Returns the value of the title tag
- `{{$PageData.Body}}` : Returns the markdown body rendered to HTML

---

## Frontmatter

Metadata such as the title of the page can be added as frontmatter to the markdown files in the YAML format.
This metadata can be accessed from the layout files with the appropriate syntax.

Currently, the following frontmatter tags are supported:

- `title` : The title of the current page
- `date`: The date of the current page
- `draft`: When set to 'true', the current page is not rendered unless the '-d' flag is used
- `scripts`: Stores the page-level scripts to be added
- `type`: Sets the type of the page. Use type `page` for regular pages, `post` for posts & `note` for notes

#### Important

> anna will not render a page unless it contains the `type` field in the frontmatter

- `description`: Stores the description of the current post previewed in posts.html
- `previewimage`: Stores the preview image of the current page
- `tags`: Stores the tags of the particular page
- `toc`: When set to 'true', a table of contents is rendered for the current page

#### Important

> anna automatically renders a table of contents for every file of `type: post`

- `authors`: Stores (multiple) author/s of a particular page
- `head`: Users need to manually specify head of the zettel in the frontmatter. Only head notes will be a part of `notes.html`

---

## Body

Anna uses [Goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark) to render markdown files, which is CommonMark compliant

A few useful goldmark extensions have been included:

- [anchor](https://github.com/abhinav/goldmark-anchor)
  - adds support for anchors next to all headers
- [figure](https://github.com/mangoumbrella/goldmark-figure)
  - parse markdown paragraphs that start with an image into HTML `<figure>` elements
- [mermaid](https://github.com/abhinav/goldmark-mermaid)
  - adds support for [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org) diagrams
- [toc](https://github.com/abhinav/goldmark-toc)
  - adds support for rendering a table-of-contents

---

## Static assets

### Images

Images can be added to the `content/` dir, `public/` dir or the `static/` dir.
The contents of the `static/` and `public/` directories and the non-markdown files present in the `content/` dir are copied to `rendered/`

The images can be referenced in the markdown files via their relative or absolute paths

### CSS

CSS can be added in the following ways:

- In an external file in the `static/` directory and linked to the layout files

  Example: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/style.css">`

- Placed inside `<style></style>` tags in the `<head></head>` of the layout files
- Inline with the html elements

---

## Site configuration

The config.yml file stores additional information regarding the layout of the site
It contains the following fields:

- `navbar`: Stores the links to be added to the navbar (same name as the markdown files)
- `baseURL`: Stores the base URL of the site
- `siteTitle`: Stores the name of the site
- `siteScripts`: Stores the javascript files to be included with every page
- `author`: Stores the author of the site

### Sample `config.yml`

```yml
navbar:
  - about
  - posts
  - tags

# make sure no trailing slash com/
baseURL: https://example.com

# Replace this with the actual canonical-url of your site
# baseURL tells search-engines (SEO), web-crawlers (robots.txt) so people can discover your site on the internet.
# It's also embeded in your sitemap / atom feed and can be used to change metadata about your site.

siteTitle: anna
siteScripts:
author: Anna
```

## Notes

Anna provides users with functionality of maintaining notes and sharing them. Notes opens another set of functionality for anna. Users can create under the `site/notes` directory. Besides similar use cases as a post, notes can be short snippets of information, code or even some kind of list that the users want. It supports some important aspects of [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/) where users can link notes to each other, and organise similar posts in a zettel.

We aren't trying to re-invent the process of making an editor that helps users maintain these zettels as there are already some fantastic applications, namely [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Ginko Writer](https://app.gingkowriter.com) and [Evergreen Notes](https://evergreennotes.com/). Our application as a rather needs to provide a generator to stitch these notes together to make it accessible on the site.

### Notes directory structure

```text
/notes
├── /zettel A
└── /zettel B
    ├── note A
    ├── note B
    └── note C
```

### Linking Notes

Notes can be linked by using callouts in markdown files such as `[[]]`. The parser will validate these links during the runtime. It checks whether there are existing valid notes with a title matching the content of the callout. If not an error is thrown and you wont be able to compile the site.

For example. If you have a note with the title `Note A` and you would like to reference it else where in another note (could even be part of another zettel). Then `[[Note A]]` would be the appropriate callout to use it.
