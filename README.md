A static site generator in go
```

Inspired by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Saaru](https://github.com/anirudhRowjee/saaru), this static site generator aims to take performance to the next level with parallel rendering, live reload and so much more, all in Go.

Pronounced: `/ɐnːɐ/` which means rice 🍚 in Kannada
